                    Launched a community/incubator hybrid for Yalies interested in startups the spring of my first year at Yale. This community’s been home to the founders of <a href="https://preparedapp.com/" target="_blank">Prepared</a> (backed by First Round), <a href="https://craniometrix.com/" target="_blank">Craniometrix</a> (backed by Y Combinator), and a handful of future founders you don’t know the names of yet.
                    <br><br>
                    As of Fall 2022, I'm starting from scratch with this project and focusing narrowly on building a small but mighty <a href="https://yesatyale.org/incubator/" target="_blank">community</a> of the best builders I know. If you're a Yalie that fits the description, <a href="mailto:jonathan.pierre@yale.edu">I'd love to chat</a>.

                    Took the spring of my sophomore year off to build <a href="https://intros.ai/" target="_blank">software</a> for digital communities.
                    <br><br> 
                    At Intros, I brought features from concept through design, set up basic PM processes, and managed QA + product analytics. Helped bring our product to public beta. <br><br>
